    <div class="warning rotated">another ritual is waiting for you. ⛧</div>
    <div class="decorated">The Fox and the Wolves</div>
    <div class="game-rules">
        <p>The rules are simple. You'll need these items:</p>
        <p class="item">1. Flour, chalk powder, or anything else to mark places.</p>
        <p class="item">2. Some friends.</p>
        <p>
            Someone in your friend group has to be the <span class="scaled">fox</span>, 
            and the rest will be <span class="rotated">wolves</span>. 
            You are the one Luna chose, so you will be the fox. 
        </p>
        <p>The fox gets a head start of 1 minute. Run as far as you can, marking your route with powder or chalk. Wolves will chase you by following the trail.</p>
        <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> No cheating. Sprinkle powder every few meters. Team up with 1 wolf, who is your companion chosen by Luna. Breaking these rules will have consequences. ψ</p>
